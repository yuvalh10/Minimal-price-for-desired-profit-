# Minimal-price-for-desired-profit

This project aims to minimize the prices of a business specializing in gel polish for nails while considering the desired profit the business owner wishes to achieve. 
The project utilizes real prices, updated to summer 2022, and employs MATLAB's CVX code "MIN_PRICE" (with certain conditions) to attempt price reduction.

Once the code has finished running, it will generate a file called "MinimalPrice" which will contain the optimal (minimum) price for the owner to achieve their desired profit, along with a rounded fixed price in an adjacent cell for the convenience of the business owner.
